A Timber and Stone Mod. Game Speed, Idle Settlers, Cheat Menu, Mod loader. http://www.timberandstonegame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=6627

Once you download the repo you need to copy the timber and stone game into the timber and stone folder inside the project. This should line the refrences up for the project. Then just run the timber and stone exe in the project folder after you build the project. When you build the project It should make a plugin.dll in the saves folder.
